        <p>I am currently a third year student currently undertaking a bachelor degree in electrical and electronics engineering at the urniversity of nairobi</p>
        <p>currently l am a student but have done internship at numerous organisations such as </p>

        <p>I decided to enroll for Moringa classes cause l develop an interest for programming since it was taught as an unit and we basically majored in C++ </p>
        <p>I want to basically be flexible in most of the languages since coding applies to my profession in tele-communication sector</p>
        <p>one of your TM  referred me to Moringa and told me alot of things about it so l searched you on Google chrome</p>
        <p>most of the alumnis sayed alot of good things about you and you have world-wide recognition and most off all you have developed worldwide programmers</p>
        <p>from my experience so far l can say l dont regret anything and it was one of the best decisions l made because you are one of the best and l feel privileged to be working with you and to form part of Moringa community</p>
        <p>l look forwad to working with you and to become a skilled developer</p>
